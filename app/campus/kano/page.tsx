              Kano State Campus

              Kano State marks a strategic expansion of the Pastor Chris Oyakhilome Skill Acquisition vision into Northern Nigeria. Established in 2025, the Kano campus was launched to meet the growing need for practical empowerment, opportunity, and spiritual community within the state.

              In a short period, we have reached over 1,000 individuals, equipping participants with relevant vocational and digital skills that promote self-reliance and economic productivity.

              Beyond skills training, the Kano initiative has recorded a remarkable spiritual impact. Through consistent teaching of God’s Word and community engagement, we have successfully established a fellowship, providing a platform for worship, discipleship, and continued spiritual growth.

              The Kano State campus stands as a growing testimony of transformation empowering lives through skills while building a strong, faith-centered community.
